# Vapi Booking Flow Fix

## Problem

The Vapi AI assistant was creating multiple bookings without proper confirmation from customers. The issues included:

1. **Premature Booking Creation**: The AI was creating bookings before confirming all details with the customer
2. **Multiple Bookings**: When a customer wanted to update information, the AI created a new booking instead of updating the existing one
3. **No Booking Context**: The AI didn't maintain context of the booking it just created, making it difficult to update

## Solution

We implemented a two-part solution:

1. **System Prompt Update**: Added specific instructions for the booking flow
2. **New Tools**: Created tools to retrieve and update bookings

### 1. System Prompt Update

Added the following instructions to the Vapi AI assistant's system prompt:

```
BOOKING PROCESS INSTRUCTIONS:

1. INFORMATION GATHERING:
   - Collect all required booking information (name, email, phone, date, time)
   - Verify each piece of information with the customer before proceeding

2. CONFIRMATION REQUIRED:
   - Before creating a booking, ALWAYS summarize all details and explicitly ask: "Would you like me to confirm this booking now?"
   - Only proceed with booking after receiving clear confirmation from the customer

3. AVOID DUPLICATE BOOKINGS:
   - Never create multiple bookings for the same customer in a single conversation
   - If a customer wants to change details, offer to update the existing booking instead of creating a new one

4. BOOKING CONTEXT MAINTENANCE:
   - After creating a booking, store the booking_id in your conversation context
   - Reference this booking_id when the customer wants to make changes

5. VERIFICATION AFTER BOOKING:
   - After creating a booking, confirm to the customer that the booking was successful
   - Inform them they will receive a confirmation email
```

### 2. New Tools

#### get_customer_bookings

This tool allows the AI to retrieve existing bookings for a customer by email, phone, or name.

**Endpoint**: `/api/vapi/booking-tools/get_customer_bookings`

**Parameters**:
- `customer_email`: Email address of the customer to search for
- `customer_phone`: Phone number of the customer to search for
- `customer_name`: Name of the customer to search for
- `limit`: Maximum number of bookings to return (default: 10)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "bookings": [
    {
      "id": "booking-id",
      "customer_name": "John Doe",
      "customer_email": "john@example.com",
      "customer_phone": "123-456-7890",
      "booking_date": "2023-03-20",
      "booking_time": "10:00:00",
      "status": "confirmed",
      "notes": "Special requests",
      "service": {
        "id": "service-id",
        "name": "Service Name",
        "price": 100,
        "duration": 60
      },
      "created_at": "2023-03-15T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

#### update_booking

This tool allows the AI to update an existing booking instead of creating a new one.

**Endpoint**: `/api/vapi/booking-tools/update_booking`

**Parameters**:
- `booking_id`: ID of the booking to update (required)
- `service_id`: ID of the service to change to (optional)
- `customer_name`: Updated name of the customer (optional)
- `customer_email`: Updated email address of the customer (optional)
- `customer_phone`: Updated contact phone number of the customer (optional)
- `booking_date`: Updated date for the booking in YYYY-MM-DD format (optional)
- `booking_time`: Updated time for the booking in HH:MM format (24-hour) (optional)
- `notes`: Updated notes or special requests for the booking (optional)
- `status`: Updated status of the booking (optional)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Successfully updated booking for John Doe",
  "booking_id": "booking-id",
  "service_name": "Service Name",
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "booking_date": "2023-03-20",
  "booking_time": "10:00:00",
  "booking_status": "confirmed"
}
```

## Improved Booking Flow

With these changes, the booking flow is now:

1. **Information Collection**: The AI collects all required booking information
2. **Verification**: The AI verifies each piece of information with the customer
3. **Summary and Confirmation**: The AI summarizes all details and explicitly asks for confirmation
4. **Booking Creation**: Only after confirmation, the AI creates the booking
5. **Context Maintenance**: The AI stores the booking_id for future reference
6. **Modification Flow**: If the customer wants to change details:
   - The AI uses `get_customer_bookings` to find the existing booking
   - The AI uses `update_booking` to modify the existing booking instead of creating a new one

## Implementation Notes

1. **Email Notifications**: Both tools send email notifications to the customer and business owner when bookings are created or updated
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling ensures the AI can gracefully handle issues
3. **Business Context**: Both tools respect the business context from the request

## Deployment

To deploy these changes:

1. Deploy the new API endpoints
2. Publish the new tool definitions to Vapi
3. Update the system prompt for the Vapi AI assistant
4. Test the new booking flow to ensure it works as expected
