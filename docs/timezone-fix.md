# Timezone Fix for Business Profiles

## Problem

The AI assistant was encountering errors when trying to get business availability. The error message was:

```
Error fetching business: {
  code: '42703',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'column business_profiles.timezone does not exist'
}
```

This occurred because the `get_business_availability` route was trying to access a `timezone` column in the `business_profiles` table, but this column didn't exist in the database schema.

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Added Timezone Column to Business Profiles Table**:
   - Added a new `timezone` column to the `business_profiles` table with a default value of 'America/New_York'
   - SQL: `ALTER TABLE "business_profiles" ADD COLUMN timezone text DEFAULT 'America/New_York'`

2. **Updated API Routes to Handle Missing Timezone**:
   - Modified `get_business_availability` route to continue even if the business profile can't be fetched
   - Added fallback to use the timezone from the request or a default value
   - Updated variable declaration from `const businessId` to `let businessId` to allow reassignment

3. **Added Timezone to Business Info Response**:
   - Updated `get_business_info` route to include the timezone in the response
   - Added fallback to 'America/New_York' if the timezone is not set

4. **Updated Other Routes for Consistency**:
   - Modified `list_business_services` and `book_business_service` routes to use `let businessId` for consistency
   - Ensured all routes can handle the case where the business ID might need to be reassigned

## Verification

After applying these fixes, the AI assistant should be able to get business availability without errors. The system will:

1. Use the timezone from the business profile if available
2. Fall back to the timezone from the request if the business profile doesn't have a timezone
3. Use 'America/New_York' as a last resort default

## Future Improvements

1. **Business Profile UI**: Add a timezone selector to the business profile UI to allow users to set their timezone
2. **Timezone Validation**: Add validation to ensure the timezone is in a valid format
3. **Timezone Detection**: Implement automatic timezone detection based on the business address
4. **Timezone Display**: Show the timezone in the UI when displaying availability and booking times
