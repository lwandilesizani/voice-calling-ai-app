# Booking Email Notification Fix

## Problem

The AI assistant (Vapi) was successfully processing bookings, but email notifications were not being sent to either the business owner or the customer. The server logs showed:

```
Error retrieving booking: {
  code: 'PGRST116',
  details: 'The result contains 0 rows',
  hint: null,
  message: 'JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned'
}
Booking notification emails sent successfully: false
```

This occurred because:

1. The email notification system was using `createRouteHandlerClient()` which depends on cookies from the request
2. When the Vapi AI assistant makes a booking (especially during phone calls), there are no cookies available
3. The system was trying to retrieve the booking data using the route handler client, which failed

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Direct Email Handling in Booking Route**:
   - Modified the `book_business_service` route to handle email sending directly within the route
   - Removed dependency on the external `sendNewBookingNotifications` function
   - Used the service client directly to get business details

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling for email sending
   - Implemented a retry mechanism if the first attempt fails
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

3. **Created Webhook for Manual Retries**:
   - Added a new webhook endpoint at `/api/webhooks/resend-booking-emails`
   - This can be called manually to resend emails for a specific booking
   - Supports both POST and GET requests for easier testing

4. **Added Automated Retry System**:
   - Created a cron endpoint at `/api/cron/retry-booking-emails`
   - This can be scheduled to automatically retry sending emails for bookings that haven't been confirmed
   - Processes bookings in batches to avoid timeouts

5. **Email Confirmation Status**:
   - Changed the workflow to only mark bookings as `email_confirmed` after emails are successfully sent
   - Added status tracking to identify bookings that need email retries

## How It Works

### Booking Process

1. When a booking is created (via Vapi or UI), it's initially marked as `email_confirmed: false`
2. The booking route attempts to send emails directly using the Resend API
3. If emails are sent successfully, the booking is marked as `email_confirmed: true`
4. If email sending fails, the system will retry once immediately
5. If both attempts fail, the booking remains marked as `email_confirmed: false`

### Retry Mechanisms

1. **Manual Retry**: Call `/api/webhooks/resend-booking-emails?bookingId=<id>` to retry a specific booking
2. **Automated Retry**: Schedule a cron job to call `/api/cron/retry-booking-emails` regularly

## Verification

After applying these fixes, the AI assistant should be able to process bookings and send email notifications without errors. The system will:

1. Send emails directly from the booking route without relying on cookies
2. Retry sending emails if the first attempt fails
3. Provide detailed error logs for debugging
4. Allow manual and automated retries for any bookings that didn't send emails

## Future Improvements

1. **Email Templates**: Move email templates to separate files for easier maintenance
2. **Queue System**: Implement a proper queue system for email sending to handle high volume
3. **Notification Preferences**: Allow businesses to customize email notifications
4. **SMS Notifications**: Add SMS notifications as an alternative to emails
5. **Email Tracking**: Track email opens and clicks for better analytics
