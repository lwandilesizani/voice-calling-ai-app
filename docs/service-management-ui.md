# Service Management UI Enhancements

This document outlines the UI enhancements made to improve service management for business owners.

## Overview

The service management UI has been enhanced to provide business owners with comprehensive tools to manage their services, availability, and business hours. These enhancements make it easier for business owners to configure their services and availability, which in turn improves the booking experience for their customers.

## New Features

### 1. Service Availability Management

A new page has been added at `/services/availability` that allows business owners to:

- View and manage availability for each service
- Set different availability for different days of the week
- Configure start and end times for each day
- Set break times during the day
- Configure buffer time between appointments
- Set maximum concurrent bookings
- View availability in a calendar format to visualize open slots and bookings

This feature helps business owners define exactly when each service is available for booking, allowing for flexible scheduling that matches their business needs.

### 2. Business Hours Management

A new page has been added at `/business-hours` that allows business owners to:

- Set general operating hours for the business
- Configure which days the business is open
- Set opening and closing times for each day
- View business hours in a calendar format to visualize open and closed days

Business hours serve as a general guideline for when the business is operating, while service availability allows for more specific scheduling of individual services.

### 3. Timezone Selection

The business profile page has been enhanced to include a timezone selector, allowing business owners to:

- Set their business timezone
- Ensure all availability and booking times are displayed correctly
- Provide accurate time information to customers

The timezone is used throughout the system to ensure consistent time representation for both business owners and customers.

### 4. Calendar Views

New calendar components have been added to provide visual representations of:

- Service availability: Shows available slots and booked appointments for each service
- Business hours: Displays open and closed days with operating hours

The calendar views offer several benefits:
- Visual representation of availability patterns
- Easy identification of open slots and busy periods
- Quick overview of the month's schedule
- Interactive selection of dates to view detailed time slots

## Navigation Improvements

- Added a link to the availability management page from the services page
- Added availability buttons for each service card
- Added a business hours link in the sidebar
- Added a business hours button on the business profile page
- Added tab navigation between list/table views and calendar views

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses:

- React hooks for state management
- Supabase for data storage and retrieval
- Shadcn UI components for consistent styling
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use
- Custom calendar components for visualizing availability

## Database Schema

The implementation leverages the existing database schema:

- `services` table for service information
- `service_availability` table for availability settings
- `service_break_times` table for break times
- `business_profiles` table for business information, including timezone
- `bookings` table for appointment data

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. Bulk editing of availability across multiple days
2. Copying availability settings from one service to another
3. Setting seasonal or holiday hours
4. Drag-and-drop interface for adjusting availability in the calendar view
5. Integration with external calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.)
6. Automated availability suggestions based on booking patterns
7. Heat map visualization to show busy periods and optimal scheduling times

## Conclusion

These UI enhancements provide business owners with powerful tools to manage their services and availability, improving both the business management experience and the customer booking experience. The addition of calendar views makes it easier to visualize and manage availability, leading to better scheduling decisions and improved customer satisfaction.
