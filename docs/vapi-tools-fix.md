# Vapi AI Assistant Tools Fix

## Problem

The AI assistant was having trouble using the tools properly. When attempting to use tools like `get_business_info`, `list_business_services`, etc., the assistant would fail to execute the tools correctly. The server logs showed errors like:

```
Error listing business services: TypeError: Failed to parse URL from undefined/api/vapi/booking-tools/list_business_services
```

## Root Cause

After thorough investigation, we identified several issues:

1. **Incorrect Tool URLs**: The tool configurations in the JSON files had incomplete URLs. They were using `${BASE_URL}` without specifying the full API path.

2. **Missing Server URL**: The assistant configuration didn't have the correct server URL for handling tool calls.

3. **Environment Variable Issues**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` environment variable was undefined, causing the URLs to be constructed as `undefined/api/vapi/booking-tools/list_business_services`.

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

### 1. Updated Tool Configurations

We updated all tool configuration files to include the full API paths:

- `get_business_info.json`: Updated URL to `${BASE_URL}/api/vapi/booking-tools/get_business_info`
- `list_business_services.json`: Updated URL to `${BASE_URL}/api/vapi/booking-tools/list_business_services`
- `book_business_service.json`: Updated URL to `${BASE_URL}/api/vapi/booking-tools/book_business_service`
- `get_business_availability.json`: Updated URL to `${BASE_URL}/api/vapi/booking-tools/get_business_availability`

### 2. Added Fallback URLs

We added hardcoded fallback URLs in several places to ensure the system works even when environment variables are not set:

```javascript
// In src/app/api/integrations/vapi/route.ts
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'https://7ae14e7d-9684-4ad1-86c0-42a0a3abda47-00-1q4kt89zrpvu0.riker.replit.dev';
```

```javascript
// In vapi/publish-vapi-config.js
const baseUrl = args['base-url'] || process.env.AI_DIALER_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'https://7ae14e7d-9684-4ad1-86c0-42a0a3abda47-00-1q4kt89zrpvu0.riker.replit.dev';
```

```javascript
// In vapi/update-assistant.js
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'https://7ae14e7d-9684-4ad1-86c0-42a0a3abda47-00-1q4kt89zrpvu0.riker.replit.dev';
```

### 3. Created All-in-One Fix Script

We created a new script `fix-tools.js` that:
- Sets the hardcoded URL as an environment variable
- Republishes the tools with updated URLs
- Updates the assistant with the correct server URL

## How to Apply the Fix

Run the all-in-one fix script:

```bash
node vapi/fix-tools.js
```

This script will:
1. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` environment variable
2. Republish the tools with the updated configurations
3. Update the assistant with the correct server URL

## Verification

After applying these fixes, the AI assistant should be able to use the tools properly. You can verify this by:

1. Making a test call to the assistant
2. Asking for business information (which should trigger the `get_business_info` tool)
3. Asking about services (which should trigger the `list_business_services` tool)
4. Checking availability (which should trigger the `get_business_availability` tool)
5. Attempting to book a service (which should trigger the `book_business_service` tool)

## Future Improvements

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set in production and development environments
2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Add fallback mechanisms for critical configuration values
3. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to provide more descriptive error messages
4. **Logging**: Add more detailed logging to help diagnose issues
5. **Testing**: Implement automated testing for tool functionality
